      <h1>About Bop Pop Challenge</h1>
      <p>
        I founded the Bop Pop challenge 6 years ago when I realized my musical passion was being unrealized.
        I wanted to push myself to actually create, so I challenged my friend to write a song in a week.
        From there, quickly other people wanted to join. The winner picks a theme, and then we each make a song
        according to that theme, voting for our favorites.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose is to help remove ego from the artistic process, making it a regular thing.
        It&apos;s a platform to push ourselves to improve, foster community, and share our creations with an audience.
        Creating art is more fulfilling when it reaches listeners, and through Bop Pop, we can support and suggest
        improvements for each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite you to join the Bop Pop Challenge, embrace the creative journey, and be part of our supportive community.
